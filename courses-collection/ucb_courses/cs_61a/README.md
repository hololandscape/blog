# Overview

The CS 61 series is an introduction to CS, with particular emphasis on software and on machines from a programmer's point of view.

* CS 61A concentrates on the idea of abstraction, allowing the programmer to think in terms appropriate to the problem rather than in low-level operations dictated by the computer hardware. It is about programming, such as functional programming, and object-oriented programming.

## What is Computer Science?

* What problems can be solved by computers?
* How can computers help us solve problems?
* What techniques lead to effective solutions?


## The Antatomy of a Revursive Function

* The `def statement header` is similar to the normal functions
* Conditional statements check for `base cases`
* Base cases are evaluated `wihtout recursive calls`
* Recursive cases are evalauted `with recursive calls`
