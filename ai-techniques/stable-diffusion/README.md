**Big thanks for** [**Stable Diffusion Art**](https://twitter.com/stable\_diff\_art)**'s and [**Hugging face Stable Diffusion**](https://huggingface.co/blog/stable_diffusion)'s article. All the contents come from Stable Diffusion Art's articles. I can't remember these things without writing them down, so I write all of them. And I will correct some of the parts of them and add more personal thinking in the future (14/06/2023).**&#x20;
