# ND Array

N D array consists of a sequence of elements. And the elements can be laid out in a rectangular grid rather than a line.

## The techniques related to the N D array
* Simulation technique
* Diagonal traversal technique

And here are programming techniques related to the N D array:

* Boundary check

All of these techniques have a basic requirement that the array's edge case must be handled properly. So, you need to know how to handle the edge case of the array. And then do more practice. The N D array part should be ok.
