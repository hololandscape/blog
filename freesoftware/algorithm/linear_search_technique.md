# Linear Search Technique

This technique for finding an element by checking through all elements one by one is known as the linear search algorithm. In the worst case, a linear search ends up checking the entire Array. Therefore, the time complexity for a linear search is O(N).

The edge case for a linear search is when the element is not present in the Array.
