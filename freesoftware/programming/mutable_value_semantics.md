## What is the mutable value semantics?

Mutable value semantics(MVS) is a programming discipline that upholds the independence of values of support local reasoning. In the strictest form of mutable value semantics, reference become second-class citizens: they are only created implicity, at function boundaries, and cannot be stored in variables or object fileds. Hence, vatiables can never share mutable stable.

In other words, MVS allows you to return multiple values form a single expression, while MVS restricts how references can be used in a program.

Here is a table that summarizes the key difference between MVS nad MVS:

| Feature| Multiple Value Semantics | Mutable Value Semantics |
| --- | --- | --- |
|What it allows|Returns multiple values from a single expression| Restricts how reference can be used in a program|
|How it is implemented| Typically uses a type system that suppors multiple values|Typically uses a programming discipline that prohibits shared mutable state|
|Advantages| Can make code more concise and easier to read| Can make code more effficient and easier to reason about|
|Disadvantages| Cna be more diffucult to understand| Can be more difficult to use in some cases|

Ultimately, the best choice of programming concept depdends on the specific needs of the program. If you need to return mutiple values from a single expression, then MVS is a good choice. If you need to write efficient and easy-to-reason-about code, then MVS is a good choice.

Here are some examples of how MVS can be used in programming:

* A function that returns both the result of an operation and an error message
* A funtion that returns a list of all the possible values of a given expression
* A function that returns a tuple of values.

MVS can be a powerful tool for writing concise, efficient, and readable code. As more programming languages start to support MVS, it is likelt to because more widely used.
