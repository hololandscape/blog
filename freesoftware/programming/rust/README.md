When I develop rust backend for the [LocalAI](https://github.com/go-skynet/LocalAI) project. Also I have been learning Rust > years in a free time but still 0 experience on it. Most of the time I am focusing on Cloud Native domain with Golang. It is not means I am an expert on Golang, but I am more familiar with Golang than Rust.

So, the founder of [go-skynet](https://github.com/go-skynet) [mudler](https://mudler.pm/) is going to add Rust backend to support more LLM. So, I am going to take this chance to head start my Rust learning journey.
