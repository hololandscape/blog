When I develop rust backend for the [LocalAI](https://github.com/go-skynet/LocalAI) project. Also I have been learning Rust > 2 years in a free time but still 0 experience on it. Most of the time I am focusing on Cloud Native domain with Golang. It is not means I am an expert on Golang, but I am more familiar with Golang than Rust.

So, the founder of [go-skynet](https://github.com/go-skynet) [mudler](https://mudler.pm/) is going to add Rust backend to support more LLM. So, I am going to take this chance to head start my Rust journey. And under the helping of [lu-zero](https://github.com/lu-zero). The framework of the new Rust backend was done. And the next step is to embed ML framework like burn and candle to support more LLM.

So, here I list some of the features of Rust that are helpful for coding in Rust. Here is the link of the mind map
