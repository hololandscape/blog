# A senario shows the perfomance of Rust and Python

I am always struggle in Leetcode. It is awful and it is not necessary steps in a interview. And I am feeling bad if I am not good at solving the algorithm questions. I have no idea why this happended.

And I always trying to from the beginner level becuase it makes me feel a little better than other levels. And I am working on a question about runing some operations on 1d array. And I submitted it by using Python3 and Rust.

This is directly show me the performance of Rust and Python in a real word case. And this makes me more interested in Rust.
