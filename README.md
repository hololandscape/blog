# ðŸš€ About

Iâ€™m Bowen Li and my code name is **Aisuko**. It looks great.

I have been doing it well until now. I am an excellent human being, today I am and, in the future, even if I bring into submission. But I will never be frustrated.

Iâ€™d like to do something interesting, like explore the GNU Hurd project. Itâ€™s cool.

And Iâ€™d like to explore the structure of the entire world. So, Iâ€™m not interested in the server, but the infrastructure needs to be updated.

I join the [Meshery organization](https://github.com/meshery) in 2020, I am the community manager until now. People there are so well. Now it is in the CNCF sandbox. I am happy with this.

I join the [GNU Hurd](https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/hurd/) in 2021, Iâ€™d like to research more about the [microkernel](https://dev.to/aisuko/the-concepts-of-microkernel-3i08) because the HA or distribution servers work on a monolithic kernel and are not stable (Itâ€™s a joke). And there are [lots of things](freesoftware/the-gnu-hurd/continue-working-for-the-hurd.md) that I need to learn and research.

In 2023, I jump into the [go-Skynet organization](https://github.com/go-skynet) which is focused on running the AI model in consumer level hardware. It is so super cool and the binding technique between two different languages is useful. And the project [LocalAI](https://github.com/mudler/LocalAI) is super cool.

In the beginning of 2024, I found a new open source community [SkywardAI](https://github.com/SkywardAI) with a group of passionate students from RMIT University, and some of contributors are my former colleagues. It is a community inspired by [LocalAI](https://github.com/mudler/LocalAI) which we want to provide the free, real open-source RAG framework and data analysis solutions that enable anyone to democratize and run AI on consumer-grade hardware.

Iâ€™m a Sky photographer on [Flickr](https://flickr.com/people/aisukoli/) and all the photos are free to download.
